# Eratosthenes

Use the improved Eratosthenes.

Your program should read in a single number from standard input

n

and the output should be the number of primes between 1 and n including n.

For example, run eratosthenes, and type:
10

the output should be:
4
because 2, 3, 5, 7 are prime <= 10
In Java, reading from standard input can be found here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-can-we-read-from-standard-input-in-java (Links to an external site.)

In C++, it is simply:
uint64_t n;
cin >> n;

# GCD

Write a program that accepts two numbers typed into standard input. Output the greatest common denominator.

Your program should be capable of handling 64 bit numbers. For example, given the input:

15 25

the output should be:

5

Your code should use Euclid's gcd algorithm using modulo arithmetic.
