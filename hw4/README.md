# Dictionary

IWrite a class HashMap using linear chaining that loads in a dictionary (given in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bwxfq4Y7f7vkTkZnVEFEcXVEWmc?resourcekey=0-mOXByawNd1BgAZIqFmdGzQ&usp=sharing (Links to an external site.)

Then open the file "spell.txt"

for example:
testing this iz teste atttest
apple apple John

print out all the words not in the dictionary: iz, teste, atttest

print out the histogram of the hash map so we can see how many bins have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 or more collisions

Then write the same functionality using a Trie and repeat. You can put all this in a single program
